# parleur.js
A Javascript library for building text parsers. Currently vary unstable until
I decide what the API should include. Still very usable though, the code is
well commented, and a lot examples can be found in the */test* directory.

Current TODOs:

* Decide on what should be included in the API and what should be removed. I
    have a feeling that a lot of stuff can be removed.
* Write a documentation for the API.
* Write an introductory article.
